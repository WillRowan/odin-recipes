<h2>The Best Homemade Cheese Pizza!</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>My husband's favorite food is pizza. He likes it plain and simple. A lot of cheese. Sometimes Hawaiian, sometimes BBQ chicken. But most of the time: extra cheese.</p>
<p>I, on the other hand, am all about the extras. I like my pizza with fun (weird?) toppings like roasted eggplant, goat cheese, sun dried tomatoes, figs, butternut squash, and honey.</p>
<p>But one thing we can agree on: really good crust. Puffy, chewy, and thick pizza crust.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1/2 recipe homemade pizza crust</li>
    <li>1/2-3/4 cup (127-190g) pizza sauce, depending how much you like (homemade or store-bought)</li>
    <li>8 ounces sliced mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>1 and 1/2 cups (6oz or 168g) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>2-3 Tablespoons (10-15g) grated parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>ground basil or Italian seasoning, to taste</li>
 </ul>   

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare the pizza dough through step 6, including preheating the oven to 475°F (246°C) as described in step 4</li>
    <li>Top the dough with the pizza sauce, then the sliced mozzarella, then the shredded mozzarella, grated Parmesan, then sprinkle with basil</li>
    <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes</li>
    <li>Slice hot pizza and serve immediately. Cover leftover pizza tightly and store in the refridgerator</li>
</ol>
