<h2>The Best Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies!</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>There are a few secrets to the best classic, chewy chocolate chip cookies.</p>
<p>Number one Don't use chips; instead, opt for a mix of milk or semisweet and dark chocolate chunks.</p> 
<p>The second is to let the dough rest overnight or longer for a more complex, toffee-like flavor.</p>
<p>Lastly, use an ice cream scooper to get even-sized cookies every time. And that's it! With these little tweaks, 
the result is a cookie that's textured on the outside, and soft and gooey on the inside. Absolutely perfect!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1/2 granulated sugar</li>
    <li>3/4 cup brown sugar, packed</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li> 1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li> 4 oz milk or semi-sweet chocolate chunks</li>
    <li> 4 oz dark chocolate chunk, or your preference</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In a bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps</li>
    <li>Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture</li>
    <li>Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies)</li>
    <li>Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper</li>
    <li>Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan</li>
    <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown</li>
    <li>Cool completely before serving</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
